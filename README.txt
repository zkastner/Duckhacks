Duckpond

Find out what's happening on campus tonight!

Duckpond is a web app that uses your weekly SLN to bring you current events at Stevens. 



This prototype of Duckpond uses a pre-determined JSON to deliver and display the week's events.
Ideally, the input to the Duckpond is the weekly SLN. It would be acquired by performing a GET request on your gmail inbox in this browser to get the contents of the email. The strengths of this input method is that it both dynamically populates data without need for persistent storage, while authenticating by checking your inbox.
